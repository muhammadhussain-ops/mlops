# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

>
> Answer:

TQDM:
We used the package tqdm which visualizes the number of iterations completed in a loop. This user-friendly tool is highly beneficial when executing computationally intensive or data-heavy tasks.

PIL: 
To import and export images in different formats we used the library Pillow/PIL. This library provided a vast range of functionalities when working with images, such as processing images of different file format.

ByteIO:
The functionality of this package is a bit more technical, then that of the other packages. The BytesIO object allowed the Image.open() function to read the data as if it were a file, even though it’s actually just raw bytes in memory.


## Coding environment

> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

To manage our dependancies we created a requirements.txt file as advised in the module M2. This txt-file contained all relevent packages to execute our project. Through the use of dependabot, we made sure to that all of our packages were up to data on the GitHub workflow. 

To get a complete copy of our development environment one would have to run the following commands: 

“python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip list
          pip install -e .
”


### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We initialized our project using the Cookiecutter template, which provided a standardized and organized foundation. 
However, we customized the structure to better fit our needs by integrating Google Cloud Storage for all our files and code, 
eliminating the need for local storage. Consequently, we only utilized specific files from the template that were relevant 
to our cloud-based approach, such as configuration files for cloud integration and essential scripts for deployment.
These deviations allowed us to leverage cloud resources effectively, ensuring our project remains scalable and maintainable. 
By adapting the Cookiecutter template to our requirements, we achieved a robust and tailored codebase that supports our 
specific workflow and deployment strategies. The use of cookiecutter also resulted in a better and more userfriendly environment
for us to build the api method in the project.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We used some of the techniques taught in section 2 to format the code and files for user-friendliness. 
This is very important for big projects since it will be chaotic to find specific files and functions in big projects if 
the project structure isn't formatted in a structural way. For example, as in the file structure provided by the course material, 
it is clear to see that everything is formatted and distributed such that it is easy to find the desired code 
or file in a big project.

> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

We were unable to train our model on the cloud within the project timeframe. However, we have established a cloud architecture 
that is nearly complete and requires only a few final adjustments to become fully operational. This setup lays the groundwork 
for future cloud-based training, which we intend to implement once the necessary refinements are made.

In the meantime, we have successfully deployed a local version of the model that can be trained using our API. 
This local implementation allows us to continue developing and testing the model training process without relying on cloud resources.
 The API-driven approach facilitates seamless interaction with the model, enabling efficient training workflows and easier 
 integration with other components of our project.

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

We have implemented API functionality for our program. We started by using Flask but switched to FastAPI since it was covered in
the course material. We integrated FastAPI into the codebase, allowing a server to be started within the project. 
When this server starts, it becomes possible to communicate with the project's main file. 
There are three available endpoints: train, evaluate, and inference.
The train function operates by connecting to the data folder and training the model by importing the neural network from 
the model folder. Once trained, the model is saved back into the model folder. The evaluate function retrieves the model and 
loads the weights from the model file, which were saved during the training process. It then evaluates the model using the entire
dataset. The inference function takes a single data point and feeds it into the model using the weights obtained from the training 
function.
With this setup, users of the project do not need direct access to the various files and folders, as all interactions are 
managed through the main file.

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**

>
> Answer:

Yes, we successfully deployed our API locally using FastAPI. Initially, we considered Flask, but FastAPI was selected to align 
with our course material. The local deployment allows users to interact with three endpoints.
To invoke the service an user would call: http://localhost:8000/train

### Question 25

> **Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for**
> **the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>

We did not implement load testing. However, if we had more time, we would have done it in the following way: 
We would use API testing to set up simulations of possible calls to our server. From there, using the 
Google Cloud Storage monitoring dashboard system, we would be able to see the load our project is subjected to. 
We were considering using the Locust framework for load testing.



### Question 26

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*
> *measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.*
>
> Answer:

No, we did not implement monitoring of our deployed model. However, implementing monitoring would significantly enhance the 
longevity of our application by allowing us to track the model's performance and health in real-time. Monitoring would enable 
us to detect and address issues such as performance degradation, unexpected errors, or increased load promptly. Additionally, 
it would provide valuable insights into usage patterns and system behavior, facilitating informed decisions for scaling and 
optimization. By ensuring the model remains reliable and efficient, monitoring would help maintain user trust and the overall 
effectiveness of the application over time.

## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> **How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do**
> **you think about working in the cloud?**

> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

We used a total of 71 kroner in credits during the project. The most expensive service was Google Cloud Storage, which accounted 
for the majority of our expenses. In general, we find working in the cloud to be highly advantageous. The cloud offers great 
scalability and flexibility, making it easy for us to adjust resources as needed and efficiently handle the project's requirements. 
Additionally, the various services and tools available in the cloud have made it easier to collaborate and optimize our workflows.

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**

> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

We have not developed any additional features for our project. However, if we had more time, we would have chosen to implement a 
front-end application for our backend model in relation to the API. This would ensure a more user-friendly interface for users when 
interacting with the project. Ideally, the front-end application would have been developed using the Streamlit framework.

### Question 29

>
> Answer:

![SS of our pipeline](figures/q29.jpeg)

Our pipeline operates as follows. A local machine connected to the internet sends a prompt to our cloud-based project. 
The project then uses Docker to set up a temporary virtual machine that acts as an operating system environment. 
This virtual machine makes an API call to our main application file. Depending on the type of request received from the 
local machine, the main file executes the corresponding tasks by accessing the necessary project files. After processing, 
the system returns a value to the local machine based on the original request. This workflow ensures that computationally 
intensive tasks are handled in the cloud, optimizing performance and resource utilization on the local machine. 
By leveraging Docker for managing virtual environments and using API-driven interactions, our pipeline maintains consistency, 
scalability, and efficient communication between local and cloud components.

### Question 30

>
> Recommended answer length: 200-400 words.
>
> Example:
> *The biggest challenges in the project was using ... tool to do ... . The reason for this was ...*
>
> Answer:

We dedicated a significant amount of time to setting up our cloud infrastructure. One of the most challenging aspects was 
configuring the Docker images and virtual machines (VMs) to create a robust simulation of an operating system capable of running 
our project seamlessly. This process required meticulous attention to detail to ensure that all components were compatible 
and integrated smoothly.
The primary difficulty lay in coordinating the numerous elements that needed to work together harmoniously. 
Each part of the system, from the Docker containers to the virtual environments, had to be precisely configured to avoid conflicts 
and ensure optimal performance. Additionally, establishing effective debugging methods was crucial. We needed to develop strategies 
to accurately identify and classify issues that arose within different files and components of the project.
In summary, the cloud setup phase was both time-consuming and complex, involving the integration of multiple technologies and the 
development of sophisticated debugging techniques.
